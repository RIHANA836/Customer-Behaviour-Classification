# Customer-Behaviour-Classification
This project focuses on predicting customer behavior to classify whether a customer will purchase a product based on their demographic information, including age, salary, and gender. By using machine learning algorithms, we can predict whether a customer is likely to purchase a product, which can help businesses target customers more effectively.
